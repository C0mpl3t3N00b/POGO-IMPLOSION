# POGO-IMPLOSION 
_SNAP, CRACKLE, POP! - POGO Rice Crispy's_

This design aims to solve the violent forces enacted on the fragile pogo-pins used inside CloudJ's magnetic Comma 3/X Mount.

These are to be 3D printed with high precision printers.

NOTE: Dimensions are not provided by the original manufacture, but are based on values shared by Erich#4634 - internal dimensions for hole spacing are strictly placeholder values until prints are attempted and iteration be made.
